# News Article Classifier  

## Overview  
This project involves classifying BBC News headlines into their respective categories (Tech, Entertainment, Sports, Politics, and Business). The classification is achieved through custom implementations of Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers.  

## Features  
- **Dataset**:  
  - Used the BBC News dataset containing categories and corresponding headlines.  
- **Preprocessing**:  
  - Applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as word tokenization.  
  - Utilized pickling to save processed data for efficient reuse.  
- **Custom Implementations**:  
  - Naive Bayes classifier developed from scratch.  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier implemented from scratch.  
- **Model Comparison**:  
  - Generated performance comparison graphs for the implemented classifiers.
